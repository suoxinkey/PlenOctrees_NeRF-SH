In order to decrease repeated stuff, we recommend to use a high-level library. You can write your own high-level library or you can just use some third-part libraries such as [ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite), [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) â€¦ etc. This can help you write compact but full-featured training loops in a few lines of code. Here we use ignite to train mnist as an example.

# Requirements
- [yacs](https://github.com/rbgirshick/yacs) (Yet Another Configuration System)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (An open source deep learning platform) 
- [ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite) (High-level library to help with training neural networks in PyTorch)
